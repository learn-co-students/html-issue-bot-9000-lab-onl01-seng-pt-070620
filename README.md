1. Open index.html in a browser. See how it, well, doesn't look _quite_ right?
2. Open index.html in your text editor
3. Visit the W3C validator at: [http://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input][VBI]
4. Copy the code from index.html and paste it into the text area
5. Click the large "Check" button
6. Use the error messages to correct the code your copy of `index.html`
7. Repeat steps 3-6 until the Html Validator reports: "Document checking
   completed. No errors or warnings to show."
8. Not only is the document now W3C-valid, it no longer looks weird

### Submitting the Lab

When your document is valid, go to the terminal and type:

`learn`

Since you're verifying the HTML structure via W3C, the test here is not
robust at all.

To move to the next lesson, type `learn submit`.
